# Events:
#### What is an Event ?
- JavaScript's interaction with HTML is handled through **events** that occur when the user or the browser *manipulates a page*.
- When the **page loads**, it is called an *event*. When the user **clicks a button**, it is called an *event* too. Other examples include events like **pressing any key**, **closing a window**, **resizing a window**  etc.
- **onclick Event** Type is the most frequently used event type which occurs when a user *clicks the left button* of his mouse, we can put our validation, warning etc., against this event type.

# Images
- To resize an image in *css* while maintaining aspect ratio, We would either set the **width** or the **height** to some value the browser will figure out what the other one needs to be to maintain the aspect ratio.    
- The width and height of the image can be specified by applying (The width property and the height property) properties to the IMG element.
- The background-image property in CSS applies a graphic  or gradient to the background of an element. 
1. **Images:**
-  Using an image on a background is simple:
> body {
  background: url(sweettexture.jpg);} 
 
 The url() value allows us to provide a file path(a data URI) to any image, and it will show up as the background for that element.

2. **Gradients:**
when using backgrounds is to tell the browser to create a gradient:
>body {
  background: linear-gradient(black, white);
}

## How do we stop  background image from repeating?

To make a background image not repeat in HTML we specify **no-repeat**in the **background-repeat** property the background image is set to *no-repeat* using the *background-rep*.

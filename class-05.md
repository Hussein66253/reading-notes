## Images:
- Usually, When we open any website the first thing our eyes see it is the images(if there is ones) so it play a vetal role in the website. 
#### How to add a image to the website:
- First we need to know the tag used for the image, the tag is < img>.
- < img> tag is an empty
element ( which means there is
no closing tag)
- Any < img> tag must contain the following two attributes: 
1. **src**: This tells the browser where it can find the image file, it can be a URL.   
2. **alt**: In case  that image it doesn't apper to the user it wiil show an alternative text that describes the
image.
- we can also add an attributeand it is **title** to provide additional information
about the image, most browsers will display the content of this attribute in a tooltip when the user hovers over the image.
- So te image tag will be like this:    
<img src=""     
alt=""  
title="">  

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Stranger_Things_logo.png"    
alt="Stranger Things TV series "     
title="STRANGER THINGES logo">

## Color:
- The CSS color property defines the foreground color of the text content for an element.
- Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue.    
- We can specify any
color in CSS in one of four ways:
  1. **RGB values**:  
  - An example is:  
  rgb(0, 191, 255)

  2. **HEX Codes**:  
  - An example is:  
  #00bfff
  3. **Color Names**:  
  - An example is:  
  DeepSkyBlue
  4. **HSLA**:  
  - An example is:  
  	hsl(195, 100%, 50%) 

- wWhen we chooes a color we must to put in consdration that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).
## Text:
- To control the choice of font, size, weight, style, and spacing we can use some properties to do it(*letter-spacing*).  
- For spacing we can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words.
- we can use *text-align* to align the text to the left, right, center, or justified.   
- we can use *font-family* to changt the font family (font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;) .

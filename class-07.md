# Domain modeling:
- *Domain modeling* is the activity of **translating** an informal description of a domain into a domain model. Domain models are used during the *requirements gathering*. 
### Why we use Domain modeling:

# Tables :
- The table tag is a ***block element*** used to create a table. It is useful when you want to represent data using *rows* and *columns*.
### How to create tables in HTML?
- To create table in HTML we use the **< table>** tag as we know tables consists of *rows* and *columns*, which can be set using one or more **< tr>**, **< th>**, and **< td>** elements.  
    1. **< tr>** tag define table row.
    2. **< th>** tag set table header.
    3. For a table cell we use the **< td>** tag.

   -  *variables* are known as **properties** of the

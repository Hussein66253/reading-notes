## HTML lists :
- HTML Lists are used to specify lists of information and all lists may contain one or more list elements( ***li*** ). There are three different types of HTML lists:

1. Ordered List ( ***ol*** )   
2. Unordered List ( ***ul*** )    
3. Description List ( ***dl*** )    
    * The HTML definition list contains following three tags:   
    dl  tag defines the start of the list.  
    dt  tag defines a term.     
    dd tag defines the term description.    
    
## Boxes :
* each HTML element CSS treat it as if it has its **own box** so to control this **boxs** we can use :   
1. borders, margin and padding.(Elliptical Shapes by using border-radius)
2. hide boxes using the display and
visibility properties.(hidden
to hides the element,
visible
to shows the element)
## Decisions and Loops :
#### switch statement
- The switch statement executes a block of code depending on different cases, it's used to perform different actions based on different conditions. we use switch to select one of many blocks of code to be executed. 
* switch syntax is:
* switch(expression) {  
  case a:   
  // code block   
  break;  
  case b:
  // code block   
  break;  
  default:  
  // code block   
}
1. The break statement is used to terminate the switch case.
2. The default case is not necessary, but it is useful when no case in switch is not matched then automatically it executes the default.

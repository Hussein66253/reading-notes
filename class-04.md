## Reasons for Pair Programming:
### Pair Programming:
An ExtremeProgrammingPractice in which two engineers participate in one development effort at one workstation. Each member performs the action the other is not currently doing.    
#### Pair Programming Benefits are:

* Increased discipline: Pairing partners are more likely to **do the right thing** and are less likely to take long breaks.  
* Improved moral: Pair programming is much more enjoyable than programming alone.  
* Mentoring: Everyone, even junior programmers, has knowledge that others don't. Pair programming is a painless way of spreading that knowledge.

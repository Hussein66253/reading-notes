## How the web works :
- First of all we need to know how the web works before going deeper:  
When someone type an address for any website the ***web server***
hosting that site could be anywhere in the
world. In order for we  find the location of
***the web server*** your browser will first connect
to a Domain Name ***System (DNS) server***. 
## HTML5:
- As any langugues *HTML5* had a privious virsion  wihch is as the following:    
**Version**  | **Year**
  -------------  | -------------
HTML      | 1991
HTML 2.0	| 1995
HTML 3.2	| 1997
HTML 4.01	| 1999
XHTML	    | 2000
HTML5       | 2014
- To make HTML5 elements work in *Internet Explorer 8*
(and older versions of IE), **extra JavaScript** is needed which we can git it for free from Google.
## What is "script"?
- A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.   
#### Objects and Methods:
- Each line writhen in the JavaScript is conten **Object** and **Method** for example:  
- > document.write('Hello world')
1. ***document*** is the *object*
2. ***write('Hello world')*** is the *method*

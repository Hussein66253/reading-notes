# Layout:
-  Usin the **layout** we can control where each element sits on a page.
##  Position elements :
- We can use:
  1. *static*: 	Default value the elements render in order as they a**ppear** in **the document flow**.
  2. *absolute*:	The element is positioned relative to its first positioned (not static) ancestor element.
  3. *fixed*:	The element is positioned **relative** to the **browser window**.
  4. *relative*:	The element is positioned **relative** to its **normal position**.
  5. *sticky*:	The element is positioned **based** on the user's **scroll position**.
  6. *initial*:	Sets this property to its **default value**.
  7. *inherit*:	Inherits this property from its **parent element**.
## fixed width and liquid layouts:
- Web page layout follows one of two different approaches: 
  1. *Fixed-Width Layouts*: These are layouts where the width of the entire page is set with a specific numerical value.
  2. *Liquid Layouts*: These are layouts where the width of the entire page is flexible depending on how wide the viewer's browser is.  

  
## Grid Layout:
- The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use *floats* and *positioning*.

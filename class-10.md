# Error Handling & Debugging
### How to look at errors in chrome?
- If there is an *error* in the JavaScript the **console** will show us where is the *error* and will display the *line* where it became a problem for the interpreter. 
### Debugging:
- The debugger statement **stops** the execution of JavaScript, and calls the *debugging* function using the debugger statement has the same function as setting a ***breakpoint*** in the code.
- Normally we can activate debugging in the browser with the F12 key, and select **Console** in.
- also we can use the **Console** to type code in it and it will show us a **result** so it we can use as *filed test* to our code.
#### Breakpoints:
- Above we said:
> The debugger statement **stops** the execution of JavaScript, and calls the *debugging* function using the debugger statement has the same function as setting a breakpoint in the code.  
- So how we do this??
- we can pause the execution of a script on any line using breakpoints then we can check the values stored in variables at that point in time, in *chrome browser*:
 1. After clicking right click in the browser and chooes inspect.  
 2. We select the Sources option.
 3. Then we select the script we are working with from the left-hand pane, the code will appear to the right.
 4. After that wefind the line number we want to stop on and click on it.
 5. Finally when we run the script, it will stop on this line we can now hover over any variable to see its value at that time in the script's execution.

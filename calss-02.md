## HTML elements:
- HTML elements is used to describe the structure of the page and we have many elements of them :
#### Superscript and Subscrip:
- when we need to write a Chemical equation or date its very recommended to use thoes two elements.
 - **Superscript**    
 *This is the wrong way*    
On the 24th of october  
*This is the right way*     
On the 4<sup>th</sup> of September  
- **Subscrip**
*This is the wrong way*
Einstein's energy equation is E = MC2   
*This is the right way* 
 E=MC<sup>2</sup>
 #### Quotations:
 - quotation is words or phrases that are taken from someone else or from literary work we can use it like the following:   
 as Shakespeare said :<q> Be not afraid of greatness</q>
 #### CSS
 - **CSS** or *Cascading style sheets* are used to format the layout of Web pages and works by associating rules with HTML elements.    
 - Any CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration for example when we have an a cslss in our HTML named **info** we can change the background color as the folowing:
 .info{ background-color =  aqua }  
 #### comments in JavaScript :
 - we can use comments in JavaScript to clarify what the code does and to make it easier for other to read and understand it, and there are to types of comments:
 1. SINGLE-LINE COMMENTS    
    we use the two forward slash characters //  and the any thing follow it is comment , it used for small comments as the name refer to.
 2. MULTI-LINE COMMENTS    
    we use the /* *any thing will be write here is a comment*  */, it used for multy line comments as the name refer to. 
    #### comparision operators:
    - Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values, an example of the Comparison operators are :  
    age = 25 when we Comparing it to :
    1. age == 25 the return is true because both of them are number. 
    2. age === 25 the return is true because both of them are number.
    3. age === "25" the return is fales because the first age is string and the second age is number.
    4. age !== 25 the return is fales because both of them are 25 as number.
    5. age <=  25 the return is fales because both of them are 25.
    - So we can say:
    1.  ==  mean equal to.
    2.  === mean equal value and equal type.
    3.  !== not equal value or not equal type.
    4.  <=	less than or equal to.

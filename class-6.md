- When we are cooding what is the most *hardest thing*, well we can list a long list but the most important ons is:
1. Learning a new technology.
2. Naming things.
3. Testing your code.
4. Debugging.
5. Fixing bugs.
6. Making software maintainable.
- So we need to know our **problem domain** to solve our problam.
# What is problem domain ?
- A problem domain is the area of expertise or application that needs to be examined to solve a problem, a problem domain is simply looking at only the topics you are interested in, and excluding everything else.
- knowing our problem domain is the hardest part of programming, to make programming easier we can do one of two things:    
1. Make the problem domain easier.
2. Get better at understanding the problem domain.
# Object Literals:
## What is object:
- Object represents one of *JavaScript's data* types, it is used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities.
## What is Object Literals:
A JavaScript object literal is a *comma-separated* list of name-value pairs wrapped in **curly braces**, object literals encapsulate data, enclosing it in a *tidy package*, this minimizes the use of **global variables** which can cause problems when combining code.
# Document Object Model:
- The Document Object Model *(DOM)* is a programming API for ***HTML and XML*** documents, it defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.
- DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes,
element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes.
- DOM trees have four types of nodes: 
1. Document nodes.
2. Element nodes. 
3. Attribute nodes.
4. Text nodes. 
### how we can select element nodes:
- You can select thems by their:
1. ID.
2. class.
3. attributes. 
4. tag name.
5. using CSS selector syntax.
